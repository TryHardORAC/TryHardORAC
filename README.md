- 🔭 I am a financial engineering student at CUHKSZ, though I plan to change my major to data science next year:)
- 🌱 Currently, I work as a research assistant at the School of Data Science under the supervision of Prof. Zizhuo Wang. My research interests focus on stochastic and robust optimization, as well as revenue management.
