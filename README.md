## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am a financial engineering student at CUHKSZ, though I plan to change my major to data science next year:)
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I work as a research assistant at the School of Data Science under the supervision of Prof. Zizhuo Wang and Prof. Yin Zhang. My research interests focus on stochastic and robust optimization and their applications in revenue management(especially online resource allocation problems). I'm also interested in designing mathematical optimization algorithms including first and second order methods.
